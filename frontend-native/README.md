# GiveIt React Native

This directory contains a React Native port of the GiveIt frontend.
It uses Expo and React Navigation. A basic **Home** screen fetches and displays
rentable items and placeholder screens are provided for other sections of the
app. A basic login screen hooks into a simple authentication context and the
Account screen displays the logged-in user's email with a logout option. Further
work is needed to reach feature parity with the web frontend.
