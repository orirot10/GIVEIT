# Push Notifications Implementation Guide

## Setup Complete âœ…

Your Capacitor Android app now has complete push notification support for chat messages using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

## What's Implemented

### Frontend (Capacitor)
- âœ… Notification service initialization on user login
- âœ… FCM token registration and server sync
- âœ… Foreground notification suppression when conversation is open
- âœ… Deep-link handling for notification taps
- âœ… Enhanced notification handler with conversation tracking

### Backend (Node.js)
- âœ… FCM token storage in User model
- âœ… Push notification sending on new messages
- âœ… Enhanced notification payload with sender info
- âœ… Android-specific notification configuration

### Android (Native)
- âœ… Firebase messaging service with notification channel
- âœ… Deep-link intent handling in MainActivity
- âœ… High-priority notification configuration

## Required Configuration

### 1. Firebase Project Setup
Ensure your `google-services.json` file is properly configured:
- File location: `frontend/android/app/google-services.json`
- Must match your app's package ID: `com.orirot.givit`
- Include both debug and release SHA fingerprints

### 2. Generate SHA Fingerprints
```bash
# Debug SHA-1
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

# Release SHA-1 (use your release keystore)
keytool -list -v -keystore your-release-key.keystore -alias your-key-alias
```

### 3. Backend Firebase Admin Setup
Ensure your backend has the Firebase Admin SDK configured:
- Service account key in `backend/config/serviceAccountKey.json`
- Firebase Admin initialized in your server

## How It Works

### Message Flow
1. User sends message â†’ Backend saves to database
2. Backend triggers `sendPushNotification()` function
3. FCM sends notification to recipient's device
4. Android shows system notification (if app in background)
5. User taps notification â†’ App opens to messages page
6. If app is in foreground and conversation is open â†’ Notification suppressed

### Foreground Suppression
- Tracks active conversation in NotificationHandler
- Suppresses notifications when recipient is viewing the sender's conversation
- Shows in-app notifications for other conversations

### Deep Linking
- Notification tap opens Messages page
- Enhanced with sender info for direct conversation access
- Handles both cold start and warm resume scenarios

## Testing

### 1. Test Notification Delivery
```bash
# Send test from Firebase Console
# Use FCM token from app logs: "Push registration success, token: ..."
```

### 2. Test Scenarios
- âœ… Background: App closed â†’ Notification appears â†’ Tap opens messages
- âœ… Foreground (different conversation): Notification appears
- âœ… Foreground (same conversation): Notification suppressed
- âœ… Deep link: Notification tap navigates to correct conversation

### 3. Debug Logs
Check Android logs for:
- `FCM` - Firebase messaging
- `PushPlugin` - Capacitor push notifications
- `MainActivity` - Deep link handling

## Build Commands

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android

# Build APK in Android Studio or
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Received
1. Check `google-services.json` is correct
2. Verify SHA fingerprints in Firebase Console
3. Ensure FCM token is being sent to backend
4. Check backend Firebase Admin SDK setup

### Notifications Not Opening App
1. Verify MainActivity deep link handling
2. Check notification intent flags
3. Ensure NotificationHandler is mounted in App.jsx

### Foreground Suppression Not Working
1. Check activeConversation state in NotificationHandler
2. Verify location.state.contactId is set correctly
3. Ensure senderId matches activeConversation

## Security Notes

- FCM tokens are securely stored and associated with authenticated users
- Notification content is truncated for privacy (100 chars max)
- Invalid tokens are automatically cleaned up by FCM error handling
- All API endpoints require authentication

Your push notification system is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
